# Webserver in C#

## Introduction
I was looking into some documentation and decided to create this project to learn C#.  
The first thing I want to do is document the phases I will go through.

**PS:** I will update this README.md throughout the course of the project.

## Project Steps

1. **HTTP Listener** {I'll need to comment the code to more}
2. **Logging**
3. **Default Routing**
   - Image Loader  
   - File Loader  
   - Page Loader  
4. **Handling Details and Errors**
